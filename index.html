        <h3>What is Grow A Frog?</h3>
        <p>Grow-a-Frog is your chance to see a tadpole metamorphosize into a frog!</p>
        <p>Grow-a-Frog is an amazing live see-thru tadpole. Watch its live heartbeat!. Perfect for class projects, science fairs, and anyone who appreciates the wonder of nature.</p>
        <p>Grows arms and legs, then MORPHS into a little baby froglet that always lives in the water and never hops out!</p>

        <h3>For Teachers!</h3>
        <p>Teachers - You are the reason Growafrog exists. Our company was founded now 35 years ago because Growafrog tadpoles are transparent and captive- bred. </p>
        <p>We came to the simple conclusion that it is a better biology lesson for students to observe a live tadpole's circulatory system, living heartbeat, and metamorphosis than to ( yikes ! ) dissect a live ( or dead ) frog.</p>
        <p>We encourage you to purchase a Grow-a-Frog for your classroom and/or follow our lesson plans to share this amazing process with your classes</p>
