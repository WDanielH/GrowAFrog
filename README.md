Bootcamp Project One - Grow A Frog Mock Site

- Project by Warren Hardell 
This project is a basic webpage set up for a business. 
- There is a real business (GrowAFrog.com) that I feel could be cleaned up and made into a more modern style site. This project is my first step toward doing that.
The site has a home page, a contact page with submission form, and a products page.
This site relies on HTML, CSS as well as Bootstrap

Future Improvement Ideas: 
1) The inspiration site has numerous other pages, I would like to include and improve on those.
2) A functional modern store front for ordering would be an improvement
3) I would like to include a gallery / video page to make the site an education destination in its own right.
